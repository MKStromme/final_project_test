					<h1>The Problem With Food Labels</h1>
					
					<hr>
					
					<p>They say 'we are what we eat', 
					but how are we supposed to know what we're eating, 
					when food lables on store products are hard to understand, 
					difficult to read, 
					and often don't contain all the information we need?</p>
				
					<p>For most people, 
					knowing exactly what is in the food they're eating, 
					isn't that important. 
					For others, 
					however, 
					it's crucial, 
					and eating the wrong thing can often lead to illnesses, 
					or in some cases, 
					even death.</p>
					
					<p>Many people who live with disabilities, 
					intellectual and/or physical, 
					are required to pay extra attention to what the products they buy contain. 
					Some might suffer from allergies to specific ingredients while others might have special dietary needs due to sickness or disability.</p>
				
					<p>Reseach have found that those who are suffering from intellectual disabilities often also have problems related to nutrition and need to be extra attentive to what they eat on a daily basis 
						<sup>

							</a>
						</sup>. 
					For them going, through a package description might prove difficult due to cognitive impairment, 
					and generally speaking, 
					the small print on lables combined with excessive information makes it a strenuous and time consuming task to skim through it all. 
					With FoodWiz, 
					you are now just one scan away from getting exactly the information you need, 
					eliminating the unnecessary need to decipher food labels.</p>

						<p>Downs Syndrome is a genetic condition where they are born with an extra chromosome which affects their physical and intellectual development 
							<sup>
								<a href="#referanse_nh2015a" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">
									[2]
								</a>
							</sup>. 
						Many people suffering from Downs Syndrome also suffer from obesity. 
						This can be due to hypothyroidism or due to inactivity which is an effect of their syndrome 
							<sup>
								<a href="#referanse_ndss" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">
									[3]
								</a>
							</sup>. 
						They also are more often prone to coeliac disease compared to the rest of the population 
							<sup>
								<a href="#referanse_downssa" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">
									[4].
								</a>
							</sup>
                            <span class="content-readmore">
							Some people with Downs syndrome are however able to live on their own and care for themselves, 
							but due to a weaker sense of judgement this often contributes to more weight gain 
								<sup>
									<a href="#referanse_jakobsen" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">
										[1]
									</a>
								</sup>. 
							Another issue which is important to keep in mind, 
							is that reading- and number ability is often lower in people with Downs Syndrome 
								<sup>
									<a href="#referanse_buckley" aria-label="link to full referance" class="ref">
										[5]
									</a>
								</sup>.
							From this we can understand that a person with Downs Syndrome has more challenges when it comes to nutrition and in understanding package labeling.
